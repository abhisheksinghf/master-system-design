# Time & Ordering Problems – Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ Why is time unreliable in distributed systems?

### Expected Answer
Because each machine has its own physical clock, and clocks may drift (clock skew). Network delays further complicate event ordering.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> There is no global clock in distributed systems.

---

## 2️⃣ What is clock skew?

### Expected Answer
Clock skew is the difference in time between system clocks on different machines.

---

## 3️⃣ Why is clock skew dangerous?

### Expected Points
- Incorrect event ordering
- Token expiry issues
- Inconsistent logs
- Conflict resolution errors

---

## 4️⃣ Does synchronizing clocks via NTP eliminate ordering problems?

### Expected Answer
No. NTP reduces skew but does not eliminate it completely, and network delays still affect ordering.

---

## 5️⃣ Why does arrival order not guarantee event order?

### Expected Answer
Because network latency can cause messages to arrive in a different order than they were sent.

---

## 6️⃣ What is a logical clock?

### Expected Answer
A logical clock is a mechanism that tracks event ordering based on causality instead of physical time.

---

## 7️⃣ What is a Lamport clock?

### Expected Answer
A Lamport clock assigns increasing counters to events to maintain a happens-before relationship across distributed processes.

---

## 8️⃣ What does the “happens-before” relationship mean?

### Expected Answer
If event A happened before event B causally, then the timestamp of A will be smaller than B.

---

## 9️⃣ Can Lamport clocks detect concurrent events?

### Expected Answer
No. Lamport clocks establish ordering but cannot always detect concurrency.

---

## 🔟 What are concurrent events?

### Expected Answer
Events that have no causal relationship and occur independently of each other.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Why is event ordering important in distributed systems?

### Expected Points
- Financial transactions
- Replication
- Event sourcing
- Distributed logs
- Conflict resolution

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Give an example where incorrect ordering causes issues.

### Expected Answer
Processing a payment before recording an order due to clock differences.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Why can’t we rely purely on timestamps for conflict resolution?

### Expected Answer
Because physical timestamps may not accurately represent causal order due to clock skew and network delays.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is the difference between physical and logical clocks?

### Expected Answer
- Physical clocks represent real-world time.
- Logical clocks track event causality.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ How do distributed databases handle ordering issues?

### Expected Answer
Using logical clocks, version numbers, or consensus mechanisms to establish consistent ordering.
