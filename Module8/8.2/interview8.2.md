# Data Security – Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ What is encryption at rest?

### Expected Answer
Encryption at rest protects data while it is stored on disk, database, or backup systems so that it remains unreadable if storage is compromised.

---

## 2️⃣ What is encryption in transit?

### Expected Answer
Encryption in transit protects data while it is being transmitted across networks using protocols like TLS.

---

## 3️⃣ Why do we need both encryption at rest and in transit?

### Expected Answer
Because data can be compromised either during transmission or while stored. Both layers protect against different threat vectors.

---

## 4️⃣ What is the difference between hashing and encryption?

### Expected Answer

- **Encryption** is reversible and requires a key.
- **Hashing** is one-way and cannot be reversed.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted.

---

## 5️⃣ Why should passwords be hashed instead of encrypted?

### Expected Answer
Because encryption can be reversed if the key is compromised, whereas hashing is one-way and safer for storing passwords.

---

## 6️⃣ What is salting in password security?

### Expected Answer
Salting adds a random value to a password before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks and ensure identical passwords produce different hashes.

---

## 7️⃣ What is secrets management?

### Expected Answer
Secrets management is the secure storage and access control of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys.

---

## 8️⃣ Why should secrets never be hardcoded?

### Expected Answer
Hardcoded secrets can be exposed in version control systems, logs, or deployments, leading to security breaches.

---

## 9️⃣ What is key management?

### Expected Answer
Key management involves securely storing, rotating, and controlling access to encryption keys.

---

## 🔟 Why is encryption useless without proper key management?

### Expected Answer
Because if encryption keys are exposed, attackers can decrypt the protected data.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is the principle of least privilege?

### Expected Answer
Each service or user should have only the minimum permissions required to perform its tasks.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What are common mistakes in data security?

### Expected Points
- Storing passwords in plain text
- Logging sensitive data
- Hardcoding secrets
- Not rotating keys
- Granting excessive permissions

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ How do you protect sensitive payment data?

### Expected Answer
- Encrypt at rest
- Encrypt in transit
- Use strong key management
- Restrict access
- Audit access logs

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is a rainbow table attack?

### Expected Answer
A precomputed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions to crack passwords without salting.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Why should API keys be rotated periodically?

### Expected Answer
To reduce the impact of key compromise and limit long-term exposure.
