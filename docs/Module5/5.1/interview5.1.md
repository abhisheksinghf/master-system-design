# Sync vs Async Communication – Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ What is synchronous communication?

### Expected Answer
Synchronous communication is a request-response model where the caller waits (blocks) until the callee returns a response.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> In synchronous communication, the caller blocks until it receives a response.

---

## 2️⃣ What is asynchronous communication?

### Expected Answer
Asynchronous communication allows a service to send a message or event without waiting for the receiver to process it.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> In asynchronous communication, the caller does not wait for processing to complete.

---

## 3️⃣ What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking?

### Blocking
Thread waits until operation completes.

### Non-Blocking
Thread continues execution and handles response later (callback/event).

---

## 4️⃣ What are the advantages of synchronous communication?

### Expected Points
- Simple to implement
- Immediate response
- Stronger consistency
- Easier debugging

---

## 5️⃣ What are the disadvantages of synchronous communication?

### Expected Points
- Tight coupling
- Cascading failures
- Higher latency
- Limited scalability

---

## 6️⃣ What are the advantages of asynchronous communication?

### Expected Points
- Loose coupling
- Better scalability
- Failure isolation
- Traffic buffering

---

## 7️⃣ What are the disadvantages of asynchronous communication?

### Expected Points
- Increased complexity
- Harder debugging
- Eventual consistency
- Requires idempotency

---

## 8️⃣ REST vs Messaging — what’s the difference?

### Expected Answer
REST follows synchronous request-response, while messaging supports asynchronous communication using queues or events.

---

## 9️⃣ When should you use synchronous communication?

### Expected Use Cases
- Login requests
- Payment confirmation
- Form submissions
- Real-time responses required

---

## 🔟 When should you use asynchronous communication?

### Expected Use Cases
- Sending emails
- Notifications
- Analytics updates
- Background processing

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ How does async communication improve scalability?

### Expected Answer
It decouples services and allows tasks to be processed independently, preventing bottlenecks in the main request flow.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What happens if a downstream service fails in synchronous communication?

### Expected Answer
The entire request fails or times out, leading to cascading failures.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What happens if a consumer fails in asynchronous communication?

### Expected Answer
The message can be retried later without affecting the main user request.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Why is idempotency important in asynchronous systems?

### Expected Answer
Because retries may cause duplicate message processing.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Give a real-world example of combining sync and async.

### Expected Answer
In a payment system:
- Payment processing is synchronous.
- Sending receipt email is asynchronous.
