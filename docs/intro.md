# Master System Design: Introduction

Welcome to the **Master System Design** documentation.

This guide is structured as a complete journey—from foundations to advanced distributed architecture—so you can think like a system designer in real projects and interviews.

## What you are going to learn (overview)

- How to break down product requirements into system design decisions.
- How to reason about scalability, latency, throughput, and consistency trade-offs.
- How to design resilient backends with databases, caching layers, and message queues.
- How to plan for reliability, observability, security, and operations at scale.
- How to communicate designs clearly in interviews using practical frameworks.

## Learning path snapshot

1. **Foundation**: Networking, OS basics, backend fundamentals.
2. **Core Design**: Requirements, scalability, CAP theorem, consistency models.
3. **Data & Performance**: Storage engines, replication, sharding, caching patterns.
4. **Distributed Systems**: Coordination, consensus, global and geo-distributed systems.
5. **Production Readiness**: SRE, cloud-native, security, cost, and architecture patterns.

## How to use this documentation

- Start with the roadmap at **Docs → Index**.
- Study each module concept page first, then use its interview page for practice.
- Focus on trade-offs and failure scenarios for every design decision.

## Recommended pace

- **Beginner**: 3–4 modules/week.
- **Intermediate**: 5–6 modules/week with interview practice.
- **Interview prep mode**: Revise high-impact modules (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15).
