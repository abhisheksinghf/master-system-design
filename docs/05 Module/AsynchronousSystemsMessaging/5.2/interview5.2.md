# Message Queues – Interview Questions

---

## 1. What is a message queue?

### Expected Answer
A message queue is a communication mechanism that allows producers to send messages to a queue, where consumers process them asynchronously.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> Message queues decouple producers and consumers.

---

## 2. Why do we need message queues in distributed systems?

### Expected Points
- Decoupling services
- Handling traffic spikes
- Improving scalability
- Failure isolation
- Enabling background processing

---

## 3. What are the core components of a message queue system?

### Expected Answer
- Producer
- Queue (Broker)
- Consumer

---

## 4. How does a message queue improve scalability?

### Expected Answer
By allowing multiple consumers to process messages in parallel and buffering excess traffic during spikes.

---

## 5. What is message durability?

### Expected Answer
Durability ensures that messages are stored persistently (usually on disk) so they are not lost during crashes.

---

## 6. What is message acknowledgment (ACK)?

### Expected Answer
An acknowledgment confirms that a message has been successfully processed. If no ACK is received, the message may be re-delivered.

---

## 7. What happens if a consumer crashes before sending ACK?

### Expected Answer
The message is re-delivered to another consumer.

---

## 8. What is a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)?

### Expected Answer
A separate queue where messages that repeatedly fail processing are sent for debugging or manual intervention.

---

## 9. What are ordering guarantees in message queues?

### Expected Answer
Some queues provide FIFO ordering, while others do not. Strict ordering often reduces scalability.

---

## 10. Why must consumers be idempotent?

### Expected Answer
Because messages may be delivered more than once (at-least-once delivery), and duplicate processing must not cause errors.

---

## 11. How do message queues handle traffic spikes?

### Expected Answer
They buffer incoming messages and allow consumers to process them at a steady rate.

---

## 12. When should you use a message queue?

### Expected Use Cases
- Sending emails
- Notification systems
- Background jobs
- Analytics processing

---

## 13. When should you NOT use a message queue?

### Expected Answer
When an immediate response is required or strong real-time consistency is needed.

---

## 14. What are common failure scenarios in message queues?

### Expected Points
- Consumer crashes
- Broker crashes
- Message duplication
- Ordering issues

---

## 15. Give a real-world example of message queue usage.

### Expected Answer
In a payment system:
- Payment is processed synchronously.
- Email and analytics updates are handled asynchronously via a queue.
