# Distributed Locks – Interview Questions

---

## 1. Why can’t we use a local mutex in distributed systems?

### Expected Answer
Because local mutexes only work within a single process or machine. In distributed systems, multiple machines do not share memory.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> Local locks don’t work across machines.

---

## 2. What is a distributed lock?

### Expected Answer
A distributed lock ensures that only one node in a distributed system can access a shared resource at a time.

---

## 3. What properties should a distributed lock provide?

### Expected Points
- Mutual exclusion
- Deadlock avoidance
- Fault tolerance
- Lock expiration (TTL)

---

## 4. Why is lock expiration important?

### Expected Answer
If a process crashes after acquiring a lock, the lock must eventually expire to prevent permanent deadlock.

---

## 5. What problem occurs if lock TTL expires too early?

### Expected Answer
Another process may acquire the lock while the first process is still working, leading to race conditions.

---

## 6. What is the risk of using a database row as a lock?

### Expected Answer
If a server crashes after acquiring the lock, the lock may remain forever unless properly handled.

---

## 7. What challenges arise in distributed locking?

### Expected Points
- Network partitions
- Process crashes
- Clock skew
- Split-brain scenarios
- Lock expiration issues

---

## 8. What is Redlock (conceptually)?

### Expected Answer
A distributed locking algorithm using multiple Redis instances where a lock is considered valid only if acquired in the majority of nodes.

---

## 9. Why are consensus systems like Zookeeper or etcd better for locking?

### Expected Answer
They provide strong consistency and reliable coordination using consensus algorithms.

---

## 10. When should you avoid distributed locks?

### Expected Answer
When idempotency or unique constraints can solve the problem more safely and scalably.

---

## 11. Why do distributed locks reduce scalability?

### Expected Answer
Because they serialize access to resources, limiting parallelism.

---

## 12. Give a real-world example where distributed locks are used.

### Expected Answer
- Preventing double payment processing
- Leader election
- Scheduled job execution

---

## 13. What is a split-brain problem?

### Expected Answer
A scenario where multiple nodes believe they hold the lock due to network partition or coordination failure.

---

## 14. Why is idempotency often preferred over locking?

### Expected Answer
Because idempotent operations allow safe retries without strict coordination, improving scalability and reliability.

---

## 15. What happens if network partition occurs during lock acquisition?

### Expected Answer
Multiple nodes may believe they acquired the lock, leading to inconsistency.
