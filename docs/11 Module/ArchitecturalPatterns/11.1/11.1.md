# Monolith vs Microservices

> Goal: Choose architecture style based on team, domain complexity, and scale.

---
## 11.1.1 Core Concepts

- Deployment coupling
- Data ownership
- Operational overhead
- Team topology alignment

---
## 11.1.2 Architecture Overview

## 11.1.3 Detailed Explanation

This topic is important in real-world system design because it directly affects reliability, latency, and operational complexity.

Use this as an interview and production checklist:
- Define goals and constraints first
- Choose patterns based on trade-offs
- Add observability and failure handling from day one
- Validate with load/failure tests

---
## 11.1.4 Failure Scenarios and Trade-offs

- Network failures and retries can cause duplicate work if idempotency is missing
- Cross-component coupling increases blast radius
- Operational complexity grows with scale; automate runbooks and alerts
- Correctness vs latency trade-offs must be explicit and documented

## 11.1.5 Common Interview Mistakes ❌

❌ Giving definitions without architecture flow
❌ Ignoring failure modes and recovery plans
❌ Not discussing metrics/SLIs for the design
❌ Missing cost and operational trade-offs
