# Common System Design Interview Mistakes

> Goal: Avoid predictable mistakes that lower interview performance even when technical knowledge is good.

---

## 17.2.1 Top Mistakes

1. No requirements clarification
2. No traffic/storage estimation
3. Over-engineering too early
4. Ignoring failure scenarios
5. No mention of observability
6. No security considerations
7. No trade-off discussion

## 17.2.2 Over-Engineering Trap

Candidates often introduce:
- Multi-region systems too early
- Complex consensus protocols without need
- Excessive microservice decomposition

Start simple, then scale the design only when constraints demand it.

## 17.2.4 Recovery Strategy During Interview
