# Designing for Failures – Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ Why are failures inevitable in distributed systems?

### Expected Answer
Because distributed systems involve multiple machines, networks, and components, any of which can fail due to hardware issues, network problems, software bugs, or human errors.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> In distributed systems, failure is normal — not exceptional.

---

## 2️⃣ What is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)?

### Expected Answer
A Single Point of Failure is a component whose failure causes the entire system to fail.

---

## 3️⃣ Give an example of a SPOF.

### Expected Answer
- A single database instance without replication.
- A single load balancer without backup.
- A single application server.

---

## 4️⃣ How do you eliminate a Single Point of Failure?

### Expected Answer
By adding redundancy, such as:
- Multiple servers
- Replicated databases
- Backup infrastructure

---

## 5️⃣ What is redundancy?

### Expected Answer
Redundancy means having multiple instances of a component so that if one fails, others continue operating.

---

## 6️⃣ What is the difference between Active-Active and Active-Passive setups?

### Active-Active
All nodes handle traffic simultaneously.

### Active-Passive
One node handles traffic; backup takes over if primary fails.

---

## 7️⃣ What is a failure domain?

### Expected Answer
A failure domain is a boundary within which failures are correlated, such as a single server rack or availability zone.

---

## 8️⃣ Why is it important to distribute systems across failure domains?

### Expected Answer
To prevent correlated failures from bringing down all replicas simultaneously.

---

## 9️⃣ What is graceful degradation?

### Expected Answer
Graceful degradation means the system continues functioning with reduced features when some components fail.

Example:
Checkout works even if recommendation system is down.

---

## 🔟 What is the fail-fast principle?

### Expected Answer
A system should quickly detect and stop using unhealthy components to prevent cascading failures.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Why should you design for the worst-case scenario?

### Expected Answer
Because distributed systems will eventually encounter failures, and planning only for the happy path leads to outages.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ What happens if you ignore SPOFs in system design?

### Expected Answer
The system becomes fragile and can experience full outages from a single failure.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ How does redundancy improve availability?

### Expected Answer
If one instance fails, other instances continue serving requests.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ In a payment system, which components must never fail?

### Expected Answer
Critical path components such as payment authorization and balance updates must be highly available.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Which components can degrade gracefully in a payment system?

### Expected Answer
Non-critical services like email notifications, analytics, or logging.
