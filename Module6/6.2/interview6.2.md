# Health Checks & Monitoring – Interview Questions

---

## 1️⃣ What is a health check?

### Expected Answer
A health check is a mechanism used to determine whether a service is functioning correctly and can handle traffic.

### Interview One-Liner ⭐
> Health checks prevent routing traffic to unhealthy services.

---

## 2️⃣ What is the difference between liveness and readiness checks?

### Expected Answer

- **Liveness Check** → Determines if the service is alive. If it fails, the service should be restarted.
- **Readiness Check** → Determines if the service is ready to handle traffic. If it fails, traffic should stop but restart may not be needed.

### Interview Gold Line ⭐
> Liveness restarts; readiness removes from traffic.

---

## 3️⃣ When should a liveness check fail?

### Expected Answer
- Application crash
- Deadlock
- Infinite loop
- Process not responding

---

## 4️⃣ When should a readiness check fail?

### Expected Answer
- Database unavailable
- Cache unavailable
- Application still starting
- External dependency failure

---

## 5️⃣ Why is readiness check important in microservices?

### Expected Answer
Because services may depend on other systems, and even if the service is running, it may not be ready to handle requests.

---

## 6️⃣ What happens if you confuse liveness and readiness?

### Expected Answer
The system may restart unnecessarily or continue routing traffic to unhealthy services.

---

## 7️⃣ What is monitoring?

### Expected Answer
Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing system metrics to ensure system health and performance.

---

## 8️⃣ What are key metrics to monitor?

### Expected Points
- Latency
- Throughput
- Error rate
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Queue backlog

---

## 9️⃣ Why is monitoring important in distributed systems?

### Expected Answer
Because issues may not be visible immediately, and early detection prevents large-scale failures.

---

## 🔟 What is alerting?

### Expected Answer
Alerting is the mechanism that notifies engineers when monitored metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is auto-scaling?

### Expected Answer
Auto-scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of service instances based on system load.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ How does auto-scaling improve reliability?

### Expected Answer
It handles traffic spikes and prevents overload by adding more instances when necessary.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What happens if you don’t monitor queue backlog?

### Expected Answer
You may miss increasing load, leading to delays and eventual system failure.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ In a payment system, what should be monitored closely?

### Expected Answer
- Payment success rate
- Transaction latency
- Error rate
- Database replication lag

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Why is alert fatigue dangerous?

### Expected Answer
Too many false alerts cause engineers to ignore alerts, potentially missing real incidents.
